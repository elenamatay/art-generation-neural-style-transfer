# Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer

**Purpose:** Build a Neural Style Transfer system to generate an image. This image is generated by using two images: a content image (the one we want to generate) and a style image (containing the style to which we want to adapt the content image).

## Overview
In this assignment, I learnt about Neural Style Transfer, an algorithm created by [Gatys et al. (2015).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

**In this notebook, I was able to:**
- Implement the neural style transfer algorithm 
- Generate novel artistic images using my algorithm 
- Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer
- Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
